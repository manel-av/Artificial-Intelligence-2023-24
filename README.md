# Artificial Intelligence

## Course Description

We explored the world of AI, covering search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and reasoning. The course introduced different techniques used in modern AI applications.

## Practical Work

We worked on two major projects:

1. **Optimizing Metro Station Connections:** We implemented search algorithms like A* and Dijkstra to find the most efficient routes between metro stations based on different criteria, such as shortest distance or minimum transfers. The project required handling weighted graphs and designing a robust system for route optimization.

2. **Image Tagging System:** Developing an AI model that automatically labels images of clothing items based on color and type. The first part involved implementing K-means to identify dominant colors in an image, while the second part used K-NN to classify different types of clothing based on training data.
At the end of the project, we evaluated our models' performance and proposed improvements based on accuracy results.
